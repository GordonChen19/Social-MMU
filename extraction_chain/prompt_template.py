You are generating answer choices for a multiple-choice question.

You are given:
- A video (the question refers to the very end of the video)
- A question about the video

The generated answer choices should be different from the example answer choices, but still plausible given the video context and question.

Requirements:
- All answers must be plausible given the video context and question.
- Each answer must be meaningfully distinct (no paraphrases or minor wording changes).
- Avoid obviously incorrect, irrelevant, or contradictory answers.
- Keep answers concise (one short sentence or phrase).
